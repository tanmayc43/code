// directed, undirected (on the basis of edges)
// weighted, unweighted (now edges have weights)
// cyclic, uncylic (closed loop, can reach one vertex from itself following a path (for cylic))


// degree is the number of connections a node has 


// complete graph - each node is connected to every other node of the graph

// disconnected graph (forest) - disconnected components

// euler graph - degree of each node is even

// hamiltonian graph - (cycle) reach one vertex from itself while visiting every other node only once

// psuedo graph -

// null graph -
